# v5.0.0

In this release we adapt phpcent for Centrifugo v4:

* `generatePrivateChannelToken` renamed to `generateSubscriptionToken` and now supports providing `sub` (user ID) claim - according to [channel auth docs](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/channel_token_auth) and [v4 subscription token migration docs](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/getting-started/migration_v4#subscription-token-migration).
* In `generateConnectionToken` method `$userId` argument is not optional anymore – it should be explicitly provided. You can still pass empty string explicitly for anonymous users.

# v4.0.0

Adapt to work with Centrifugo v3.

* Deprecated `history_remove` removed (in favour of `historyRemove`)
* Deprecated `presence_stats` removed (in favour of `presenceStats`)
* Drop support for PHP < 7.0.0

# v3.1.1

* option to force IPv4 addresses when resolving hostnames, see [#44](https://github.com/centrifugal/phpcent/issues/44) and [#45](https://github.com/centrifugal/phpcent/pull/45). Thanks [Steve Therrien](https://github.com/SteveTherrien)!

```php
$client->forceIpResolveV4();
```

# v3.1.0

* support `channels` JWT claim in `generateConnectionToken` function - which is an array of server-side channels to subscribe (see [docs](https://centrifugal.github.io/centrifugo/server/server_subs/)). Thanks, [Julius TM](https://github.com/juliustm)
